Loseit! Is a popular calorie-counting app and website that is often used for weight control. 
The usability engineers primarily hoped to address the difficulties navigating the app in order to perform simple tasks. For the first task, the administrator asked users to set their own goal, which was found to be difficult to perform during the heuristic evaluation. Once the has been created and a goal has been set, it is difficult to find the location to adjust that weight loss goal. In addition, there is an extraneous “Goals” tab at the bottom of the app that appears to be for adjusting goals, but is just another tab that is only really useful if you purchase the premium version. For the second task, the administrator asked users to enter food or exercise into the log, which is the primary purpose of the app. For the final task, the engineers wanted to see how easy it was to customize the app for a specific user. The administrator asked users to create a new exercise because some people may perform exercises not in the database, or a user may be from a different country and want to use the app with different units of measurement. This pilot test was performed in a room on the 3rd floor of UCLA Powell Library. The test administrator and data logger were both present in the testing room. The session captured the participant's navigational choices on the app, comments, facial expressions, questions, feedback, overall satisfaction ratings, and task completion rates. 
The test began with an introduction by the test administrator explaining that the test was going to be recorded and the user will be asked to answer honestly and from their own perspective, with no right or wrong answers. The particpant was then shown a consent form and required signed it in order to move on the to the next section, a background questionnaire gauging the user's familiarity with the app. Next, pre-test questions were asked for first impressions, and then trial tasks were performed. After all three tasks, the user was shown a post-test questionniare examining the ease, time spent, and usefulness of each task. Finally the user completed an overall evaluation of the app using a 7-point Likert scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree), a product satisfaction card, and a user demographic questionnaire.

I believe that the pilot test went well overall. There were moments that I could have worded the questions better, but I tried to use the most common terms, such as “settings” in my questions, rather than “profile” which would prompt the user to look for a user icon. My reasoning for this is that most people would go to settings to adjust their goals, and I wanted to expose the odd wording used in the app under the User Profile and how difficult it was to navigate that section. There was a point in the test where I should have spoken up about how the form specifically said “5 cards,” and the user only selected 2. I would have mentioned it earlier, and then if he could not select all five cards, I would have let him move on. Also, when giving instructions to the user to think aloud, I may have primed the user to look out for frustrations, such as when I asked him to see if it was easy to use or frustrating. I should have just simply explained to him to say whatever comes to his mind when using the app. I am aware that I may have inconsistently given praise, so in the future I will remember to be more consistent in my responses. Finally, I would have closed the blinds in the back of the video or maybe asked him to remove his glasses because they make his facial expression slightly more difficult to see clearly. In the future, I will keep these insights in mind to be more impartial and let the user take control of the test. I will also be more considerate when selecting the test environment. 

I believe the results from this test were very useful. It clearly showed that finding goals or adjusting a simple weight loss goal is difficult on this app, and putting many different settings under the user profile icon in the top right makes the app unnecessarily difficult to navigate. In addition, I found that people don’t really use the “+” icon in the bottom middle of the page since it is clearly meant to be used to add foods or exercises. Instead, they used “+” next to each meal or exercise to enter their data. It was also surprising how difficult it could be to add a new recipe or exercise, since there is no specific tab or section for it. Finally, customizability proved not to be too difficult once the user had gone through the user profile tab. Customizability was found to not be difficult once the user has spent some time on the app, but new users are not likely to spend too much time learning the app. The app could be improved so that new users can intuitively find the settings that are most pertinent and useful to them in a shorter amount of time.
