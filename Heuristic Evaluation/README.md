## Ziyue Qi DH-150

Apps Evaluated:

CalorieKing- A minimalistic calorie counting app, that provides the most basic funcitons such as submitting calories eaten a day, how much exercise done per day, and the option to customize a simple goal. It is very easy to navigate but could have more options to make app useful for many different types of users. 

LoseIt! - LoseIt! is another calorie-counting app that has more features than CalorieKing. It has been around longer and therefore has more settings. It provides more options to customize goals and shows more features on each tab in the app. 

Overall Evaluation: 

CalorieKing is much more simplistic and has the most basic features a user hoping to stay healthy or lose weight would use. However, this does make it a bit more difficult to customize preferences and settings for your goals. In contrast, Loseit! has too many features and even though the app tries to be simplistic, it visually appears overwhelming. This app however is useful for people who like to have options and want to use the app for many different purposes. The ideal app would lie in the middle: have the simplistic features and easy accessibility of CalorieKing,  while the ease of access and customizability of LoseIt!.
