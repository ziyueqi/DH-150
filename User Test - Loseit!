> On my user test, I primarily hoped to address the difficulties navigating the app in order to perform simple tasks. For my first task, I asked users to set their own goal, which I found difficult to do in my heuristic evaluation. Once you have created an account and set a goal, it is difficult to find the location to adjust that weight loss goal. In addition, there is an extraneous “goals” tab at the bottom of the app that made it seem like that should be where you adjust goals, but is just another tab that is only really useful if you purchase the premium version. For my second task, I asked users to enter food or exercise into the log, which is the primary purpose of the app. I did not expect users to have too much difficulty with the task, except for entering custom recipes, as it is hard to find a section explicitly for entering recipes. For my final task, I wanted to see how easy it was to customize the app for a specific user. I asked users to create a new exercise because some people may perform exercises not in the database, or a user may be from a different country and want to use the app with different measurement units.
